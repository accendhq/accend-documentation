# Financial Statement Ratios Definition

**Working Capital**

$$
\text{Working Capital} = \text{Current Assets} - \text{Current Liabilities}
$$

Definition

Working capital is the difference between a company's current assets and current liabilities, representing the funds available to meet short-term obligations and operate the business efficiently.

Understanding Working Capital

Why it matters: Working capital measures a company's operational liquidity and financial health over the short term. It indicates the ability to cover immediate expenses and invest in daily operations.&#x20;

* A positive working capital is generally favorable, signifying that a company can meet its short-term debts and operational needs.&#x20;
* A negative working capital may signal potential liquidity problems, raising concerns about the company's ability to continue its operations smoothly.

Worth to note: Companies aim to maintain an optimal level of working capital to balance liquidity and profitability.\


**Change in Working Capital**

$$
\text{Change in Working Capital} = \text{Working Capital}_{CY} - \text{Working Capital}_{PY}
$$

Definition

Change in Working Capital represents the difference in a company's working capital between two consecutive periods, typically the current year (CY) and the previous year (PY). It indicates how the company's operational liquidity has changed over time.

Understanding Change in Working Capital

Why it matters: This metric measures the shift in a company's short-term financial health and operational efficiency.&#x20;

* A positive change means that more funds are tied up in the company's operations, possibly due to increased inventory or accounts receivable.&#x20;
* A negative change suggests that the company has freed up cash from its working capital, potentially enhancing liquidity.&#x20;



**Working Capital Turnover Ratio**

$$
\text{Working Capital Turnover Ratio} = \frac{\text{Net Sales}}{\text{Working Capital}}
$$

Definition

The Working Capital Turnover Ratio measures how efficiently a company uses its working capital to generate net sales. It indicates the amount of revenue produced for each unit of working capital employed in the business.

Understanding Working Capital Turnover Ratio

Why it matters: This ratio assesses a company's operational efficiency by revealing how effectively it utilizes its short-term assets and liabilities to support sales activities.&#x20;

* A higher ratio is generally favorable, showing efficient utilization of working capital to boost sales. However, an excessively high ratio may indicate insufficient working capital, potentially leading to liquidity issues and difficulty in sustaining operations.&#x20;
* A low ratio might suggest underutilization of resources or overinvestment in current assets, such as excessive inventory or slow-moving receivables.

Worth to note: Companies strive to balance this ratio to ensure they are efficiently using their working capital without compromising liquidity.



**Quick Ratio**

$$
\text{Quick Ratio} = \frac{\text{Cash \& Cash Equivalents} + \text{Marketable Securities} + \text{Accounts Receivable}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}
$$

Definition

The Quick Ratio, also known as the Acid-Test Ratio, measures a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations using its most liquid assets, excluding inventory.

Understanding Quick Ratio

Why it matters: The Quick Ratio evaluates a company's short-term liquidity by focusing on assets that can be quickly converted into cash. By excluding inventory, which may not be easily liquidated, it provides a stringent assessment of a company's capacity to pay off current liabilities promptly.&#x20;

* Ratio above 1.0x: Generally indicates that the company has sufficient liquid assets to cover its current liabilities without relying on the sale of inventory.
* Ratio below 1.0x: Implies that the company might struggle to meet short-term obligations promptly.

Worth to note: However, ideal Quick Ratio levels can vary by industry; some industries operate effectively with lower ratios due to faster cash conversion cycles or reliable cash flows.



**Current Ratio**

$$
\text{Current Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Assets}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}
$$

Definition

The Current Ratio measures a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations using its current assets. It indicates how well a company can pay off its debts that are due within one year with assets that can be quickly converted to cash.

Understanding Current Ratio

Why it matters: The Current Ratio is a key indicator of a company's short-term financial health and liquidity. It compares the resources available to settle immediate liabilities, providing insights into operational efficiency and financial stability.&#x20;

* Ratio above 1.5x: Generally indicates good short-term financial strength, as assets exceed 1.5 times the company's liabilities.
* Ratio below 1.5x: Raises concerns about the company's ability to meet short-term obligations, potentially indicating liquidity issues.

Worth to note: A very high Current Ratio isn't always better. It could indicate that the company is not efficiently using its current assets or not taking advantage of short-term financing. Ideal ratios vary by industry, so it's important to compare the ratio with industry peers for a more accurate assessment.



**Runway**

$$
\text{Runway} = \frac{\text{Ending Cash Balance}}{\left( \frac{\text{Operating Cash Flow} + \text{CAPEX}}{12} \right)}
$$

Definition

Runway measures the number of months a company can continue its operations using its current cash balance, considering the average monthly net cash outflow from operating activities and capital expenditures.

Understanding Runway

Why it matters: The Runway metric assesses a company's financial longevity by determining how long its cash reserves will last under current spending levels. It is especially crucial for startups and businesses that are not yet profitable. The key components are:

* Ending Cash Balance: The total cash and cash equivalents available at the end of a period.
* Operating Cash Flow: Cash generated or used by the company's core business operations.
* CapEx (Capital Expenditures): Funds used by a company to acquire or upgrade physical assets such as property, industrial buildings, or equipment.

By adding Operating Cash Flow and CapEx, we calculate the total cash burn per year, which, when divided by 12, provides the average monthly cash burn rate. This metric helps companies understand how efficiently they are using their cash and when they might need additional financing. \


**Total Debt**

$$
\text{Total Debt} = \text{Short-Term Debt} + \text{Long-Term Debt}
$$

Definition

Total Debt represents the sum of a company's short-term and long-term debt obligations. It includes all interest-bearing liabilities that a company has accrued, reflecting the total amount owed to creditors.

Understanding Total Debt

Why it matters: Total Debt is a key indicator of a company's financial leverage and capital structure. It helps creditors and investors assess the level of risk associated with the company's financing methods.&#x20;

* A higher total debt implies more leverage, which can enhance returns during good economic times but may pose significant risks during downturns. \


**Net Debt**



\text{Net Debt} = \text{Total Debt} - \text{Cash \\& Cash Equivalents}

Definition

Net Debt is a financial metric that represents the amount of debt a company holds after accounting for its cash and cash equivalents. It reflects the company's ability to pay off all its debts if it were to use its most liquid assets.

Understanding Net Debt

Why it matters: Net Debt provides insight into a company's financial leverage and overall debt burden relative to its liquid assets. By subtracting cash and cash equivalents from total debt, it offers a clearer picture of the company's actual debt obligations.&#x20;

* A higher net debt indicates more leverage, suggesting greater financial risk due to higher debt levels compared to readily available cash.
* A negative net debt occurs when a company's cash and cash equivalents exceed its total debt obligations. It generally indicates a strong liquidity position and suggests a healthy financial status

Worth to note: Excessive cash holdings might indicate that the company is not effectively utilizing its capital to generate higher returns.

\


**Total Equity**

\text{Total Equity} = \text{Total Assets} - \text{Total Liabilities}

Definition

Total Equity, also known as shareholders' equity or owner's equity, represents the residual interest in a company's assets after all liabilities have been deducted. It reflects the net value that belongs to the shareholders or owners of the company.

Understanding Total Equity

Why it matters: Total Equity is a key component of a company's balance sheet and provides insight into its financial health and stability. It indicates how much of the company's assets are financed through shareholders' investments rather than borrowed funds.&#x20;

* Consistently positive and growing total equity is generally seen as favorable, indicating financial strength and shareholder value creation.&#x20;
* Decreasing total equity may indicate losses, dividend payouts, or share buybacks.
* Negative total equity, where liabilities exceed assets, could signal financial distress or insolvency risks, raising concerns about the company's ability to meet its obligations.&#x20;

\


**Tangible Equity**

\text{Tangible Equity} = \text{Total Assets} - \text{Total Liabilities} - \text{Intangible Assets}

Definition

Tangible Equity represents the net value of a company's physical assets after subtracting all liabilities and intangible assets. It reflects the shareholders' equity that is backed by tangible assets such as property, equipment, and inventory.

Understanding Tangible Equity

Why it matters: Tangible Equity provides insight into the actual physical net assets that a company holds, excluding intangible assets like goodwill, patents, and trademarks, which may not have immediate liquidation value. This metric is crucial for assessing a company's financial strength and stability, especially in scenarios like liquidation or bankruptcy where only tangible assets can be sold to cover liabilities.&#x20;

\


**Debt to Equity Ratio**

\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total Debt\}}{\text{Total Equity\}}

Definition

The Debt to Equity Ratio measures a company's financial leverage by comparing its total debt to its total equity. It indicates the proportion of financing coming from creditors (debt) versus shareholders (equity).

Understanding Debt to Equity Ratio

Why it matters: The Debt to Equity Ratio assesses how a company finances its growth and operations, highlighting the balance between debt financing and equity financing.&#x20;

* Ratio below 1.0x: Generally indicates that a company is primarily financed through equity, suggesting lower financial risk but potentially less aggressive growth.
* Ratio around 1.0x: Suggests a balanced approach between debt and equity financing.
* Ratio above 1.0x: Implies that a company relies more on debt financing, which may increase financial risk due to higher interest obligations.
* Negative ratio: Occurs when a company's total equity is negative, signaling financial distress or insolvency risks.

Worth to note: Companies aim to maintain a Debt to Equity Ratio that aligns with industry standards and their risk tolerance.&#x20;

* A higher ratio might concern creditors and investors due to the increased risk of default.
* A very low ratio could indicate underutilization of financial leverage, potentially missing out on growth opportunities.

\


**Debt to Tangible Equity Ratio**

\text{Debt to Tangible Equity Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total Debt\}}{\text{Tangible Equity\}}

Definition

The Debt to Tangible Equity Ratio measures a company's financial leverage by comparing its total debt to its tangible equity (total equity minus intangible assets). It assesses the proportion of financing coming from creditors relative to the shareholders' tangible investment in the company.

Understanding Debt to Tangible Equity Ratio

Why it matters: This ratio provides a more conservative view of a company's financial leverage than the Debt to Equity Ratio, as it's typically higher. It focuses solely on tangible assets, excluding intangible assets like goodwill, patents, and trademarks that may not have immediate liquidation value. By comparing total debt to tangible equity, it offers insights into the company's ability to cover its debts with real, physical assets in the event of financial distress.

Worth to note: Companies with significant intangible assets may naturally have higher ratios due to lower tangible equity.

\


**Net Debt to Equity Ratio**

\text{Net Debt to Equity Ratio} = \frac{\text{Net Debt\}}{\text{Total Equity\}}

Definition

The Net Debt to Equity Ratio measures a company's financial leverage by comparing its net debt (total debt minus cash and cash equivalents) to its total shareholders' equity. It indicates the proportion of debt financing relative to equity financing after accounting for cash reserves.

Understanding Net Debt to Equity Ratio

Why it matters: This ratio provides a more favorable view of a company's financial leverage than the Debt to Equity Ratio, as it's typically lower. It provides insight into how a company finances its operations and growth using debt versus equity while considering its liquidity position. By factoring in net debt, it accounts for the company's ability to repay debt using readily available cash and cash equivalents.

* Negative net debt (when cash and equivalents exceed total debt) can result in a negative ratio, signaling strong liquidity and a solid ability to cover debt obligations.

Worth to note: In some cases, negative net debt and negative equity will result in a positive Net Debt to Equity Ratio. While mathematically correct, this positive ratio is misleading and doesn't provide the usual insights we expect from this metric.

\


**Debt to EBITDA Ratio**

\text{Debt to EBITDA Ratio} = \frac{\text{Debt\}}{\text{EBITDA\}}

Definition

The Debt to EBITDA Ratio measures a company's ability to pay off its incurred debt by comparing its total debt to its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). It provides insight into the company's leverage and capacity to meet debt obligations using operational earnings.

Understanding Debt to EBITDA Ratio

Why it matters: This ratio assesses how many years it would take for a company to pay back its debt if both debt and EBITDA remain constant and all EBITDA is used for debt repayment. A lower Debt to EBITDA Ratio indicates that the company is less burdened by debt relative to its earnings, suggesting a stronger ability to service its debt.

* Ratio below 3.0x: Generally considered acceptable or healthy for most industries.
* Ratio between 3.0x and 4.0x: May warrant closer examination but is often acceptable in stable industries.
* Ratio above 4.0x: May signal that a company is highly leveraged and could face challenges in meeting its debt obligations.

Worth to note: For small and medium-sized companies specifically, a ratio between 1.5x and 2.0x is often considered acceptable.

* It is important to note that the ratios can vary significantly by industry.&#x20;
* Capital-intensive industries may operate with higher ratios.&#x20;
* The appropriate ratio can depend on factors like company size, industry norms, and specific business circumstances.

\


**Net Debt to EBITDA Ratio**

\text{Net Debt to EBITDA Ratio} = \frac{\text{Net Debt\}}{\text{EBITDA\}}

Definition

The Net Debt to EBITDA Ratio measures a company's financial leverage by comparing its net debt (total debt minus cash and cash equivalents) to its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). It indicates how many years it would take for a company to pay off its net debt using its operational earnings.

Understanding Net Debt to EBITDA Ratio

Why it matters: This ratio provides a more favorable view of a company's financial leverage than the Debt to EBITDA Ratio, as it's typically lower. This ratio provides insight into a company's ability to service its debt obligations with its operating cash flow. By considering net debt, it accounts for the company's liquidity position, reflecting the debt that remains after using available cash reserves.&#x20;

\


**Total Liabilities Ratio**

\text{Total Liabilities Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total Liabilities\}}{\text{Total Assets\}}

Definition

The Total Liabilities Ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed through liabilities. It indicates the percentage of a company's assets that are funded by debt obligations rather than equity.

Understanding Total Liabilities Ratio

Why it matters: This ratio provides insight into a company's financial structure and leverage by comparing total liabilities to total assets.&#x20;

* Ratio below 50.0%: Indicates that less than half of the company's assets are financed through liabilities, suggesting a more conservative capital structure with lower financial risk.
* Ratio between 50.0% and 70.0%: Suggests a moderate level of debt financing, indicating a balanced approach between debt and equity.
* Ratio above 70.0%: Implies that a significant portion of assets is financed through liabilities, raising concerns about financial stability and the potential for solvency issues during economic downturns.

Worth to note: Companies strive to maintain a Total Liabilities Ratio that aligns with industry standards and their risk tolerance, balancing the benefits of leverage with the need for financial stability.&#x20;

* A higher ratio suggests that a greater portion of the company's assets is financed through debt, which may increase financial risk due to higher obligations to creditors.

\


**Equity Ratio**

\text{Equity Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total Equity\}}{\text{Total Assets\}}

Definition

The Equity Ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed through shareholders' equity. It indicates the percentage of total assets funded by investors rather than creditors, reflecting the company's financial leverage and stability.

Understanding Equity Ratio

Why it matters: The Equity Ratio is the complement of the Total Liabilities Ratio, and it always equals 1 minus the Total Liabilities Ratio. The Equity Ratio provides insight into a company's capital structure by highlighting how much of the company's assets are owned outright by shareholders.&#x20;

* A higher ratio suggests that the company relies more on equity financing and less on debt, indicating a conservative approach with lower financial risk. This can enhance financial stability and reduce the burden of interest payments.

\


**EBITDA**

\text{EBITDA} = \text{Operating Profit (Loss)} + \text{Depreciation} + \text{Amortization}

Definition

EBITDA stands for Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization. It measures a company's operational profitability by adding back non-cash expenses (depreciation and amortization) to operating profit, providing insight into earnings from core business activities before accounting for financing, tax and accounting decisions.

Understanding EBITDA

Why it matters: EBITDA provides a clearer view of a company's operating performance by excluding non-operational expenses and non-cash charges. This metric helps creditors and investors assess the company's ability to generate cash flow from its core operations, making it easier to compare profitability across companies and industries with different capital structures and tax environments.&#x20;

\


**EBIT**

\text{EBIT} = \text{EBITDA} - \text{D\\\&A}

Definition

EBIT stands for Earnings Before Interest and Taxes. It measures a company's profitability from its core operations by subtracting depreciation and amortization expenses from EBITDA, thus excluding the effects of financing and taxation.

Understanding EBIT

Why it matters: EBIT provides a more conservative view of a company's profitability than EBITDA, as it includes non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization. By accounting for these expenses, EBIT offers insight into a company's operational efficiency and profitability by focusing solely on income generated from regular business activities before considering financing and tax decisions.

\


**Funds From Operations (FFO)**

\text{FFO} = \text{Net Income} + \text{D\\\&A} - \text{Gains on Sale of Assets}

Definition:

Funds From Operations (FFO) is a financial metric used to measure the cash generated from a company’s operational activities. It adjusts net income by adding back non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization (D\&A) and subtracting gains from the sale of assets.

Understanding FFO:

Why it matters: FFO provides creditors and investors with a clearer picture of a company’s operating performance by excluding the effects of non-cash accounting items and one-time gains or losses.&#x20;

Worth to note: This is particularly relevant in the real estate industry, where assets typically appreciate over time, but accounting depreciation reduces net income despite this appreciation. By adding back depreciation and amortization, FFO reflects the true economic value of the assets. Excluding gains on the sale of assets ensures the focus remains on recurring operating income.

\


**EBITDA Interest Coverage Ratio**

\text{EBITDA Interest Coverage Ratio} = \frac{\text{EBITDA\}}{\text{Interest Expense\}}

It indicates how well a company's operational earnings can cover its total debt service requirements.

Understanding Debt Service Coverage Ratio

Why it matters: The DSCR provides insight into a company's financial health and solvency by assessing whether it generates sufficient earnings to cover its debt payments. By including both interest and principal repayments in the denominator, the DSCR offers a comprehensive view of the company's debt obligations relative to its operational earnings.

* Ratio above 1.5x: Considered strong, indicating the company can comfortably cover its debt obligations with its operational earnings.
* Ratio between 1.0x and 1.5x: Indicates that earnings are just sufficient to cover debt payments, leaving little room for error or unexpected expenses.
* Ratio below 1.0x: A red flag suggesting the company may not generate enough earnings to meet its debt obligations, increasing the risk of default.

Worth to note: Companies aim to maintain an adequate DSCR to ensure financial stability and demonstrate their capacity to manage debt effectively. Creditors and investors closely monitor the DSCR when evaluating a company's credit risk.&#x20;

* A higher ratio means the company has ample earnings to service its debt, reducing the risk of default and enhancing its creditworthiness. It also enhances the company's ability to secure financing on favorable terms.&#x20;
* A consistently low or declining ratio may prompt creditors and investors to reassess the company's creditworthiness.&#x20;

\


**FFO to Current Debt Ratio**

\text{FFO to Current Debt Ratio} = \frac{\text{FFO\}}{\text{Short Term Borrowings} + \text{CPLTD\}}

Definition

**DuPont Analysis**

\text{ROE} = \text{Net Profit Margin} \times \text{Asset Turnover} \times \text{Equity Multiplier}

Definition

DuPont Analysis is a comprehensive financial performance framework that decomposes Return on Equity (ROE) into three key components: Net Profit Margin, Asset Turnover, and Equity Multiplier. This method provides a detailed understanding of the factors driving a company's ROE by examining profitability, efficiency, and financial leverage.

Understanding DuPont Analysis

Why it matters: DuPont Analysis decomposes ROE to help stakeholders identify the underlying drivers of a company's financial performance. By breaking ROE into three distinct components, it offers insights into different aspects of the business:

* Net Profit Margin: Measures profitability, indicating how much profit a company generates from its revenues after accounting for all expenses.
* Asset Turnover: Measures the efficiency in using assets to generate revenue.
* Equity Multiplier: Measures the financial leverage, showing the extent to which a company is using debt to finance its assets.

Worth to note: By analyzing each component, DuPont Analysis helps determine whether a company's ROE is driven by strong profitability, efficient asset utilization, or high financial leverage. This breakdown allows for a clearer understanding of overall financial performance.&#x20;

* For instance, if ROE is low due to poor asset turnover, the company can focus on improving operational efficiency or asset utilization.&#x20;
* Conversely, if ROE is high primarily due to a high equity multiplier, it may signal increased financial risk from higher debt levels.

\


**Effective Interest Rate**
